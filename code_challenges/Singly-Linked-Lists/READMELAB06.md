# Singly Linked List
linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed

## Challenge

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- append 

arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

- insert before

arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified

- insert after

arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

### Pass on this tests
- Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
- Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
- Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
- Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
- Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
