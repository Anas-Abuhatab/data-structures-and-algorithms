# Stacks and Queues
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. 
Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

## Challenge
- [x] Can successfully push onto a stack
- [x] Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
- [x] Can successfully pop off the stack
- [x] Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
- [x] Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
- [x] Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
- [x] Can successfully enqueue into a queue
- [x] Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
- [x] Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
- [x] Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
- [x] Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
- [x] Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception

## Approach & Efficiency
