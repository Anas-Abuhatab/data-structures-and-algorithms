# Trees
Trees implementation with three classes: Node, BinaryTree, and BinarySearchTree

## Challenge
Create three classes, Node, BinaryTree, and BinarySearchTree. Using test-driven development, implement/test the following features:

Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal

## Approach & Efficiency
Time : O(N)
space : O(1)

## API

[The code](trees/trees.py)

[The test](tests/test_trees.py)
