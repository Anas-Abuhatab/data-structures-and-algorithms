# Tree Intersection

## Challenge
* Create a method that takes in two bts and uses a hashtable to return all the common values between the trees.
## Approach & Efficiency

* Space: Space: O(1) (space is constant in relation to input)
* Time: Time: O(n) (time is dependent on the number of elements that we need to traverse)
