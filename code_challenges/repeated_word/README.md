# repeated_word

## Challenge
* Create a method that takes in a string and uses a hashtable to return the first word that is repeated twice.
## Approach & Efficiency

* Space: O(1) (space is constant in relation to input)
* Time: O(n) (time is dependent on the number of elements that we need to traverse)
