# Singly Linked List
linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed

## Challenge

- Write a function called zip lists
- Arguments: 2 linked lists
- Return: Linked List, zipped as noted below
- Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
- Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
- You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O is O(1) constant
