# Singly Linked List
linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed

## Challenge

Pass on this tests

Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
Can properly insert into the linked list
The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O is O(1) constant
